          <p>
            My name is Nathan Meyer. I am 22 years old and currently a student at
            Grand Canyon University.
          </p>
          <p>
            History:I was homeschooled by my parents through a homeschooling
            organization called Bethel Baptist Academy. I earned my High-School
            diploma in June of 2016, shortly afterward I started attending Cypress
            College in California. I would attend Cypress for about 4 years, earning
            a certificate in Computer Programming before transferring over to Grand
            Canyon University in the Fall of 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interests: My current interest is in software development, which I am a
            course for atGrand Canyon University. When not working on schoolwork, I
            am usually either listening to music, helping around the house, or
            playing video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experiences: Currently I have a high school diploma and a certificate in
            computer programming. I also perform clerical duties at my church, and
            in the past have helped my church put on events, such as various parties
            for Halloween, 4th of July, and Christmas, as well as a 5-day summer
            program for children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plans:I plan to earn a Bachelor’s in Software Development at Grand
            Canyon University. After I earn my BS, I plan to search for a job in my
            relevant field and gain experience that I can use to secure a position
            for myself.
